# Positronium Kernel

Positronium is the kernel of an operating system that is yet to be developed.

This project is meant to be an opportunity to write what the [Unnamed OS Kernel](https://gitlab.com/unnamed-os/kernel) was supposed to be.

Some parts are going to be taken from that kernel. Consider Positronium to be the "v2".

Let's do this!
